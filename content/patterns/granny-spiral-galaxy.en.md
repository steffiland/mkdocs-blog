This weekend, I wanted to crochet a spiral circle and embed it into a square shape, so that I can eventually turn it—along with my other recently crocheted squares—into a finished blanket.

I found the inspiration and a great basic tutorial at [Villa Monti](https://villa-monti.blogspot.com/2012/11/freebie-anleitung-hakelspirale.html?sc=1769327070586&m=1#c6974682964265290040) and the free pattern [Candy Daze](https://www.garnstudio.com/pattern.php?id=7358) from Garnstudio.

You can see my design [here](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/haekelsteffi/granny-spiral-galaxy). The crochet pattern (both written and with a crochet chart) will be available right here very soon. 🙂
